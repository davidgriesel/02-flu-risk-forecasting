# Key Insights


## Vulnerable Populations - Who?
Adults aged 65 and older exhibit the widest variation and account for the vast majority of all influenza-related deaths.

  <em>*Adults aged 65 and older account for more than 60% of all influenza-related deaths — a trend that reinforces CDC classifications of this group as high risk.*</em>

  <em>*The 65+ age group shows a significantly wider spread and the highest median number of deaths, reflecting both elevated mortality and greater variation compared to younger age groups.*</em>

## Seasonality – When?
Although the annual severity of influenza varied considerably, peak mortality consistently occurred in January, with Southern states often reporting the highest totals — though vulnerable states were not limited to that region.

    <em>*Influenza deaths rise in November, peak sharply in January, and decline through April. The South shows a notably higher average peak compared to other regions.*</em>

    <em>*Influenza-related deaths vary from year to year, with notable surges in 2013 and 2015. The average annual death count across the period is 73,158 confirming that while flu season is consistent in timing each year, its severity can fluctuate.*</em>
