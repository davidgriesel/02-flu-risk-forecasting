| Adults aged 65 and older account for more than 60% of all influenza-related deaths — a trend that reinforces CDC classifications of this group as high risk. | The 65+ age group shows a significantly wider spread and the highest median number of deaths, reflecting both elevated mortality and greater variation compared to younger age groups. |


## Seasonality – When?
Peak mortality occurred in January each year, with Southern states often reporting the highest totals — though at-risk states weren’t limited to that region.
